# LogicMate v3

# Initialization

It's mandatory to have python 3.10.16 installed.

There is a file `setup.sh` that will install all the dependencies for you. You can run it with the command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

If you don't have permission to run the script, you can run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Then run the script again.

To enter the virtual environment in your terminal, run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To exit the virtual environment, run:

```bash
deactivate
```
